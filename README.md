🚗 **Kaggle Car Price Prediction**

This repository houses the comprehensive analysis and solution implementation for the Kaggle Car Price Prediction competition, where the objective was to forecast the sale price of used cars based on a multitude of features and conditions.

🔍 _Exploration and Analysis_
The project journey began with thorough data exploration using **R**, leveraging libraries such as **dplyr** and **ggplot**. Missing data were carefully handled, and feature engineering techniques were applied to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. Exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable.

🛠️ _Model Selection and Deployment_
A variety of **machine learning models** were explored and implemented using **caret**, **ranger**, **randomforest**, and more. Techniques including **xgboost**, **linear regression**, **multiple regression**, and **random forest** were evaluated to determine the most effective model for the task. The selected model was deployed to generate predictions on new data.

📈 _Performance Evaluation_
Throughout the project, the focus was on optimizing model performance, measured primarily by the root mean square error (**RMSE**). Strategies for improving model accuracy were meticulously documented, along with diagnostic steps taken to address encountered bugs and challenges.

📝 _Comprehensive Documentation_
The repository includes detailed documentation outlining the entire analytical process, from data preprocessing to model selection and evaluation. R code snippets are provided to offer insights into the implementation of various techniques and methodologies.

🎯 _Objective_
The overarching goal of this project was to develop a sophisticated predictive model capable of accurately forecasting the sale price of used cars.
